# Prosperity
Web Application centered around tracking your calorie and nutrition goals, as well as tracking your exercises, 
training routines, and aimed to improve your life overall.

## Overview
The purpose behind this project is to serve as a cleaner and more efficient alternative to fitness and nutrition apps such as MyFitnessPal.
Often times I find myself wondering if there are better, more suitable apps for tracking food and calories, as well as organizing my training routines.
With Prosperity I hope to develop an app that can be used to only help with the essentials of tracking food/calories, as well as consolidating all of my workout
routines and training into one application. It will start as a web application to get my general understanding of the design, and then I will develop a mobile application.
